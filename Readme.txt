To run this weather app you must have installed nodeJS and typescript.

To check if you have them installed open command prompt and type 'npm -v' for nodeJS and 'tsc -v' for typescript.

If you dont have them then in the command prompt type 'npm install -g npm' to install nodeJS

and then type 'npm install -g typescript' to install typescript.

Then in the command prompt navigate to the folder that you saved this project with 'cd YOUR DIRECTORY'.

Then in the command prompt type 'tsc app.ts' or 'npx --package typescript tsc app.ts' to create the app.js file so you can run the project.

If you did all these steps correctly now you can just run index.html.
